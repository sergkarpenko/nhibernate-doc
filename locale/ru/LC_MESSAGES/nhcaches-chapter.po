"An NHibernate session has an internal (first-level) cache where it keeps its"

"belongs to a given session and is destroyed with it. NHibernate provides a "
"*second-level cache* system; it works at the session factory level. A "
"second-level cache is shared by all sessions created by the same session "

"An important point is that the second-level cache *does not* cache instances"
" of the object type being cached; instead it caches the individual values of"
" the properties of that object. This provides two benefits. One, NHibernate "
"doesn't have to worry that your client code will manipulate the objects in a"
" way that will disrupt the cache. Two, the relationships and associations do"
" not become stale, and are easy to keep up-to-date because they are simply "
"identifiers. The cache is not a tree of objects but rather a map of arrays."
